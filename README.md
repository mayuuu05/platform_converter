## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Flutter** 🚀: Cross-platform mobile development framework.
- **SQLite** 🗄️: Local SQL database for storing contact information.
- **Provider** 🔄: State management for theme switching and CRUD operations.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Add Contacts** ➕:
   Users can add new contacts by filling in the contact details and saving them.

2. **View Contacts** 👀:
   Users can view a list of their saved contacts on the main screen. Clicking on a contact displays more details.

3. **Edit Contacts** 📝:
   Users can select any contact and edit the information, which will update in the database.

4. **Delete Contacts** 🗑️:
   Users can delete any contact, removing it permanently from the local storage.


5. **Theme Switching** 🌞🌚:
   The app allows users to switch between light and dark modes. The selected mode is saved, so it persists when the app is reopened.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Flutter SDK (version X.X.X)
- Android Studio or Xcode for platform-specific development and testing.
